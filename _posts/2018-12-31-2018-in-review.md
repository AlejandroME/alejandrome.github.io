2018 has reached its EOL. As every single side project, sometimes it's hard to get things done, specially when you have family to care about. This year I've written only [one post](https://alejandrome.github.io/state-of-oss) here and definitely I don't want to abandon this blog. So, a proposal that I've promised to myself is to blog more often and blog about things that I consider useful to everyone that takes the time to read me.

This year I had a breaking point in my professional career because I officially started to work with an US-based company (a very big and important one) and I'm in charge of helping to take technical decisions with my team and also to give technical advice. I have the experience in a previous project but not at the current scale, so definitely it's an interesting challenge that I have to address.

Expect at least a couple of posts about some findings and ruminations that I may have.

This project is not dead!

Happy new year to everyone
