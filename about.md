I'm Alejandro Marín, a software developer based in Medellín, Colombia.
Currently I work for [S4N](http://s4n.co/) developing mostly in Scala.

The vast majority of the posts that you'll find here will be about DistSys,
Scala and its surrounding frameworks / toolkits; and occasionally about
random stuff that I like (music, aviation, concerts / festivals, [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astantler)).

This is my "personal notebook" because I will write about things that I'm
currently learning, so any feedback will be much appreciated.
