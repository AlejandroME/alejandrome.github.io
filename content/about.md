Hi there! I'm Alejandro Marin, a software developer originally from Colombia, now living in Canada. I've spent about 15 years working with enterprise software, doing everything from coding to designing the big picture as an architect - though I must admit, coding is where my heart really lies.

I'm really into understanding Distributed Systems, anything that has to do with data, Functional Programming, and strongly-typed languages. These are my bread and butter, and I love digging deep into these topics.

Away from the keyboard, you'll find me hiking, enjoying a good cup of coffee (yeah, it's a clich√©, but it's true!), geeking out over aviation, playing Geoguessr, and diving into books (and Wikipedia pages!) filled with random facts.

I hope this blog gives you a glimpse into my learning journey about these topics.

### If you want to chat

I am always willing to have a conversation about software and other topics. You can [drop me an email here](http://scr.im/alejandrome).
