I always loved writing.

In fact, my job requires a good deal of it — [ADRs](https://adr.github.io/), user stories, Proof of Concept outcomes, amongst others.

I attempted to maintain a blog a few times before, but they didn't survive the test of time, or my commitment to consistent writing. 

I'm a firm believer that writing is one of the best ways to learn and share knowledge. Yet, I often grapple with the idea that my content may not hold value unless it's something groundbreaking or a research-paper-like post. I'm at a stage where I want to enhance my understanding of subjects that are challenging yet fascinating, like Distributed Systems. The best way I know to do this is through hands-on experimentation, failing, documenting the journey, and then trying again.

### Inspiration

I pay close attention to people I truly respect in the DistSys space: [Phil Eaton](https://eatonphil.com/), [Alex Petrov](https://www.databass.dev/), [Marc Brooker](https://brooker.co.za/blog/), [Martin Klepmann](https://martin.kleppmann.com/) and others. They all share one common trait — _they write_. Some of them pen their thoughts without the fear of not producing the most structured or brilliant post. To ordinary folks like me, their content is nothing short of extraordinary.

Also, looking to break the perfectionism that always holds me back and slows me down in my learning process, I will [embrace](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/) [writing for myself](https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/03/why-i-blog.html), and that's the _raison d’être_ of this blog.

If you find anything of what I'll write here useful, I am very glad that my ramblings and maybe _stupid questions_ shed some light on similar questions, or issues you have. I'd also love it [if you let me know](http://scr.im/alejandrome) if it was useful!

### Open for feedback

If you have feedback, insights, corrections or anything you think may help me to shape my learning process, and you have the willingness to share it with me, I'd be forever grateful. You can contact me [via email](http://scr.im/alejandrome), or through my socials.


### The end

That's it. Expect more soon :)
